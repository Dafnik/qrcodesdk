# @qrcodesdk/node

## 0.0.2

### Patch Changes

- 210c615: Replace the renderer and styling APIs with the new `matrix`, `style`, `accessibility`, and `image` option groups. Rename visual styling types, renderer image options, and CLI flags to match the new vocabulary. Add `@qrcodesdk/core/payload` for payload helpers, expose them from the core entry point, and improve rendering performance across SVG, canvas, and PNG output.
- 358292a: Refresh generated package READMEs with clearer setup, renderer, customization, download, and runtime guidance. Expand the Angular peer range to support Angular 20 through 22.
- 358292a: Improve SVG, canvas, image, and PNG rendering performance by reusing resolved styling, grouping drawing work into color layers, compacting square modules, and reducing repeated allocation and encoding work.
